This project predicts the present price of a car based on factors such as car age, kilometers driven, fuel type, transmission, ownership, and brand. The project involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, scaling, regression model training, and performance evaluation.
The objective of this project is to predict the present price of a car using machine learning based on factors such as car age, kilometers driven, fuel type, transmission, ownership, and brand.

⚙️ Steps Performed

Loaded and analyzed the car price dataset

Performed exploratory data analysis and visualization

Handled duplicates and outliers

Applied feature scaling and feature engineering

Converted categorical variables using one-hot encoding

Split data into training and testing sets

Trained a regression model

Evaluated performance using Mean Squared Error and R² score

🛠 Tools Used

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib, Seaborn

✅ Outcome

The regression model effectively predicts car prices based on multiple influencing factors, demonstrating the practical application of machine learning in price estimation.
